### Homeworks
* Homework 01 - [New Internship at the Mechanic](/Homework%2001/HW01.pdf)
  - Description: Congratulations on your new computer science internship at… the local mechanic? The owner really wanted your
help based on your CS 1331 knowledge with keeping track of cars she’s been servicing at all her shops in the city.
To complete this assignment, you will apply your knowledge of classes, constructors, the this keyword, and
encapsulation. As such you will be creating three classes – Mechanic, Car, and ShopDriver – these classes
will simulate a car going in for a checkup in the real world plus revenue management for the mechanic. As always,
use good design and follow the principles of object-oriented programming!

* Homework 02 - [Vehicle Database](/Homework%2002/HW02.pdf)
  - Description: You are a developer for the legendary racer, Carroll Shelby, and his company Shelby American Inc. He needs your
help to keep track of his various cars. Your job is to create a vehicle database representing all of the various
vehicles that Shelby has that utilizes the basics of inheritance, hierarchies, and abstract classes.
  - Grade: 98/100
* Homework 03 - [File I.O.](/Homework%2003/HW03_Revised.pdf)
  - Description: In this assignment you will get practice with file I.O., polymorphism, and exception handling. You will be provided a folder named satellite_data with several files in it. This is the test data set you will use to verify your code works. In addition, you will be provided with a java class called SatelliteTLEParser, which we are providing to you to handle the messier work of reading the TLE format. You will write your program in a Java class called SatelliteDataConverter and it should use Java’s built in File I/O classes and methods to iterate through the folder, open each file, load the data within, pass the data to the parser method, and then write that data out to a new file. Your code should be able to handle any valid data we give it – do not hardcode to the provided test data.
